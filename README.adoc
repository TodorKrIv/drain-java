= drain java

I was inspired by a blog article from one of my colleague :

=> https://sayr.us/log-pattern-recognition/logmine/

I wanted to see if I could implement this in Java.
I bootstrapped the code from a simple Java file tail follow, actually
not really a tail since I'm reading all the file.

Following the discussion we had, there is a few sources that
could serve as inspiration:
